-features

-dataset dimensions ; how many rows and columns
statisical summary



dataset
-transform natrual language to numbers
get pc understand content , ml understand the patterns in
the numbers
-feature transform text into numbers to pick patterns
then connect them

=classifier on weka they determine how the pattern 
is going to be learned

-pattern testing , percentage split gives a percentage 
of training the model on our data and the rest of the percentage for testing
the model.overfitting when learning trends that might not exist 
in the real world .

-classifier with rules 10 then start

the atrribute that has true or false connects the correct classification

baseline = number/totalnumberofdata above 17% is good

-condusion matrix = right right,wroun wroung ,should on columns

-more features affect the percentages accuracy

overfitting // aeRCH MEANING blunt information ,production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular dataset. vbvgv 
sparsity // search  

to add more features classifier decision tree .in rules . priority based on information gain 


















class distribution
